      Hawa Mahal was built by<br> Kachhwaha Rajput ruler<br> Maharaja Sawai<br> Pratap Singh in the year<br>1799.When the maharaja saw<br> the structure of Khetri Mahal<br> in Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan, he <br>was so impressed that he <br>decided to build a palace <br>modeled on it. Hawa Mahal,<br>also called the Palace of <br>Breeze, was the result of <br>that inspiration.This five-<br>storied structure was designed by <br>Lal Chand Ustad as an <br>extension of the City Palace. <br>Starting from the City Palace’s <br>edge, Hawa Mahal extends to<br> the women’s chambers aka zenana. <br>During those days, the Purdah<br> system was strictly followed and <br>Royal Rajpur women weren’t allowed <br>to show their face to <br>strangers or even appear in <br>public.
