      Hawa Mahal was built by Kachhwaha Rajput ruler Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh in the year 1799. When the maharaja saw the structure of Khetri Mahal in Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan, he was so impressed that he decided to build a palace modeled on it. Hawa Mahal, also called the Palace of Breeze, was the result of that inspiration.  This five-storied structure was designed by Lal Chand Ustad as an extension of the City Palace. Starting from the City Palace’s edge, Hawa Mahal extends to the women’s chambers aka zenana. During those days, the Purdah system was strictly followed and Royal Rajpur women weren’t allowed to show their face to strangers or even appear in public. The palace comprises 953 windows which enabled them to get a glimpse of the day-to-day activities and festivities happening on the street below without appearing in public.
